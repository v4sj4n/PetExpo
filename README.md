# PetExpo FrontEnd + Backend

This is a simple backend project for a shop called PetExpo, the api uses docker to create a db container and express to create an api with all the crud operations :)

## The backend is done in Express and the dependencies it uses are:

- **cors** for cross-origin resource sharing with the frontend
- **mongoose** for connecting with the mongodb database
